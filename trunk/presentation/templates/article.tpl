					<p>	The Voodoo Graphics, introduced in 1996, is the first 3dfx graphic processor for the PC market.
						Featuring the most powerful techincal solutions for stunning 3D full-scene rendered worlds
						and awesome image quality, 3dfx brought you a new 3D impressive visual experience directly from the
					 	expensive SGI graphics workstations, starting a new era for the PC entertainment market with the 
					 	creation of the Voodoo Architecture. It's not just about polygons.
					 	It's about quality, fill-rate, and cost!</p>
					<p>	Most PC graphics chips try to be all things to all people. But for games, great performance isn't 
						about WinBench or how fast a spreadsheet scrolls. Mind-blowing game play comes from interactivity 
						and visual realism, and today's graphics hardware has got to do both. If you've played Descent or
						NASCAR, you've seen the state-of-the-art in software-only 3D texture mapping. But to render complex
						scenes at 30+ Hz, 640 x 480 double buffered, in 64k dithered colors without blocky textures and 
						texture aliasing, software-only solutions just aren't enough! Next-generation games need 3D graphics
						hardware that delivers perspective corrected, Z-buffered, LOD MIP mapped, bi-linear or advanced 
						filtered textures in real time - and that's just for starters. For even greater realism, the coolest 
						games deserve special effects: per-pixel fog, translucency, transparency, and texture compositing, 
						animation and morphing. So if you've dreamed of having an SGI Reality Engine in your PC but haven't 
						yet won the lottery, check out Voodoo Graphics from 3Dfx Interactive.</p>
